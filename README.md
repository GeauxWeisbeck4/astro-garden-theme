**What is a digital garden?**

You should read this article about [the history of digital gardens](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history) written by [the anthropologist, Maggie Appleton](https://github.com/MaggieAppleton). She also has a list of [digital gardeners](https://github.com/MaggieAppleton/digital-gardeners) that you can check out for great examples on what a digital garden looks like. 

There are six patterns that Appleton describes as defining features of a digital garden:

1. **"Topography over timelines"**: Digital gardens prioritise interconnection rather than  chronological dates. Reading paths are based on interests and links, not time.
2. **"Continuous growth"**: Digital gardens are never ‘finished’: posts are always being added to, edited and developed over time.
3. **"Imperfection and learning in public"**: Digital gardens are explicitly imperfect. Ideas are made public at an early stage. Posts are labelled to indicate their state of maturity: how polished or unpolished they are.
4. **"Playful, personal, and experimental"**: Each digital garden is different because it reflects the personal needs and interests of its gardener.
5. **"Intercropping and content diversity"**: Gardens are multimodal: words,  images, podcasts, videos, documents...
6. **"Independent ownership"**: Own your own space if you can.  Back up your work so you can transfer it if needed.

*Thank you for the [awesome infographic](https://sites.google.com/view/digital-gardens/garden-features) that shared these patterns by Appleton.*
